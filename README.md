# nba-first-name-game
First Name Game inspired by Shaq not knowing any player names despite being an analyst.

A picture/name/player description is shown on screen and you have to select from a multiple choice list of names what that player's first name is.

## Features
* API calls for player info and ID numbers
* Template literal use for url with ID numbers to grab player pictures on separate link
* Array map to match data from API to javascript teamName object to get the actual team names
* Array shuffeling and implementation to generate random player and names
* Makes fun of Shaquille O'Neal for not actually watching basketball 

## Improvements
* More robust point system - timer based for more points based on speed of choice
* Better way to capture and display incorrect players
* Smoother animations and general improvements to UI/UX
